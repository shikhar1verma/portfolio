Over {{experience_years}}+ years I've led platform and product teams, from greenfield to large‑scale migrations. My work spans edge compute, ML‑assisted applications, and internal developer platforms. I care deeply about clear APIs, robust testing, and fast feedback loops. Outside of work I mentor engineers, write about strategy and architecture, and contribute to open source.",
